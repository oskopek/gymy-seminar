A seminar grouping system.

=== Problem statement

A school provides custom curriculum for all senior students, as a means of preparation for graduation and successive studying.
The school lists classes (called "seminars") and students select a subset, which they wish to study the next term.

A Teacher teaches a specific Seminar. Students select Seminars. Seminars can be split up into Subseminars, if the demand
is greater than the capacity (the number of Subseminars per each Seminar is set manually).
Seminars are assigned into groups (or blocks) which are taught at the same time.

The respective hard constraints that have to be met are:

* Students have to pick a selected number of Seminars.
* Teachers cannot teach two seminars in one Group.

The soft constraints that should be optimized:

* Students cannot attend two seminars that are planned into one Group.
* Students can be assigned any of the Subseminars of a Seminar they chose, such that it minimizes collisions with other constraints.

=== Building
